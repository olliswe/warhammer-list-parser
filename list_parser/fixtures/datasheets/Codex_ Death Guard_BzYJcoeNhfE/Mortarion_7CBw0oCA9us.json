If it does, after the attacking unit has finished making its attacks, that **DEATH GUARD** unit can shoot as if it were your Shooting phase, but when resolving those attacks it can only target that enemy unit (and only if it is an eligible target).\nBoon of Death\nIn the Fight phase, when a friendly **DEATH GUARD** unit within 6\" of this model is selected as the target of an attack, this model can use this ability. If it does, until the end of the phase, each time a model in that **DEATH GUARD** unit is destroyed by a melee attack, if that model has not fought this phase, roll one D6. On a 2+, do not remove it from play; that destroyed model can fight after the attacking unit has finished making its attacks, and it is then removed from play."
